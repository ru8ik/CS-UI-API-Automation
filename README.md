Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review my technical assessment!

I approached the test using a variety of methods, and I must admit it took a bit longer than I initially anticipated (Iâ€™m a bit rusty), but the challenge was engaging and enjoyable.

Once again, I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.
